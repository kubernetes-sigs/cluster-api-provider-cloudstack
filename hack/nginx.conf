# This NGINX conf is meant to emulate an external load balancer used on a shared network.
# This is to test that CAPC works properly when building with Control Plane endpoints behind an external FQDN LB.
# Use this via:
#  docker run --name nginx-container --rm -p 8082:8082 -v $(pwd)/hack/nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf nginx
user  nginx;

events {
    worker_connections  1024;
}

# This section is probably not even necessary, but can be useful for demo/testing LB purposes.
http {
    include       /etc/nginx/mime.types;
    default_type  application/octet-stream;

    # For demo purposes, fire up as many demo NGINX apps as desired via:
    # Use via `docker run -P -d nginxdemos/hello` and then `docker ps` will list the ports in use. 
    # Then add their addresses and ports as below.
    # upstream nginxexample {
    #     server <server address>:<port> max_fails=3 fail_timeout=10s;
    # }
    # server {
    #     location / {
    #     proxy_pass http://nginxexample;
    # }}
}

# TCP LB and SSL passthrough.
# Add as many IPs as desired.
stream {
    upstream kubeendpoints {

        # server <server1 IP>:6443 max_fails=3 fail_timeout=10s;
        # server <server2 IP>:6443 max_fails=3 fail_timeout=10s;
    }

    server {
        listen 8082;
        proxy_pass kubeendpoints;
    }
}

# Note:
#   Mac firewalls can be temporarily disabled via `watch pfctl -d`.i
#   This is required if load balancing from a Mac with the default packet filter enabled.
#   For other OSs verify the firewall is not blocking desired ports.
