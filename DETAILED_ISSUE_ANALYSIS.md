## Priority Matrix

### Critical (P0) - Must Fix
1. **Issue #454**: User account deployment failure
2. **Issue #293**: Resource cleanup bug

### High Priority (P1) - Should Include
1. **Issue #457**: CAPI v1.11.0 compatibility
2. **Issue #446**: RBAC proxy conflicts

### Medium Priority (P2) - Nice to Have
1. Documentation improvements based on identified issues
2. Enhanced error handling and user experience improvements

### Low Priority (P3) - Future Releases
1. **Issue #421**: Can be closed if already addressed
2. **Issue #443**: Superseded by newer CAPI version testing

## Impact Assessment

### User Experience Impact
- **High Impact**: Issues #454, #293 directly prevent users from successful deployments
- **Medium Impact**: Issue #446 affects upgrade experience
- **Low Impact**: CAPI compatibility issues are forward-looking

### Technical Debt Impact
- **High**: Resource cleanup bug indicates architectural gaps
- **Medium**: RBAC proxy conflicts suggest infrastructure complexity
- **Low**: CAPI compatibility is standard maintenance

### Security Impact
- **High**: Resource cleanup bug could lead to unintended exposure
- **Medium**: User permission issues could indicate broader security gaps
- **Low**: Other issues are primarily functional

## Recommended Release Scope

### Must Include (Non-negotiable)
1. Fix user account deployment issue (#454)
2. Fix resource cleanup bug (#293)
3. CAPI v1.11.0 compatibility (#457)

### Should Include (High Value)
1. Resolve RBAC proxy conflicts (#446)
2. Comprehensive testing of all fixes
3. Documentation updates

### Could Include (If Time Permits)
1. Performance improvements
2. Enhanced logging and observability
3. Additional e2e test scenarios

## Resource Requirements

### Development Effort
- **Critical Fixes**: 4-6 weeks (2 developers)
- **CAPI Compatibility**: 2-3 weeks (1 developer)
- **Testing & QA**: 3-4 weeks (1 QA engineer + developers)
- **Documentation**: 1-2 weeks (1 technical writer)

### Infrastructure Requirements
- CloudStack test environments
- Multiple CAPI versions for compatibility testing
- CI/CD pipeline updates for new test scenarios

## Success Metrics

### Functional Metrics
- All critical bugs resolved with verification tests
- CAPI v1.11.0 compatibility confirmed
- No regressions in existing functionality

### Quality Metrics
- Unit test coverage maintained above 85%
- All e2e tests passing
- Security scan with zero critical findings

### User Experience Metrics
- Deployment success rate >95%
- Documentation clarity improvements
- Reduced support ticket volume for covered issues

## Conclusion

The next release should focus primarily on critical bug fixes (#454, #293) while incorporating important compatibility updates (#457). The RBAC proxy issue (#446) should also be addressed to improve the upgrade experience. This combination provides the maximum value to users while maintaining project momentum and quality standards.
